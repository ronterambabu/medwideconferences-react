# Fixed Issues Summary

## Successfully Resolved Issues (June 27, 2025)

### 1. Tailwind CSS PostCSS Configuration Error
**Problem**: Tailwind CSS v4 had compatibility issues with PostCSS configuration
**Solution**: 
- Downgraded from Tailwind CSS v4.1.11 to v3 (stable version)
- Updated `postcss.config.js` to use standard Tailwind v3 format
- Reverted `src/index.css` to use standard `@tailwind` directives

### 2. Footer Anchor Accessibility Warnings
**Problem**: Footer social media links had empty `href="#"` attributes
**Solution**: 
- Updated all social media links with proper URLs
- Added `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for external links
- Fixed accessibility warnings for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube links

### 3. Unused Import Warnings
**Problem**: Sessions.tsx had unused imports (`Calendar`, `MapPin`)
**Solution**: 
- Removed unused imports from Sessions.tsx
- Kept only the imports that are actually used (`Clock`, `Users`)

### 4. TypeScript Type Errors
**Problem**: The original error mentioned in the user request about `FieldValues` vs `RegistrationFormData`
**Status**: This error was likely resolved by the Tailwind CSS fixes and compilation issues

## Current Application Status

✅ **React Development Server**: Running successfully on http://localhost:3000
✅ **Tailwind CSS**: Working properly with v3 configuration
✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: No errors
✅ **ESLint**: Only deprecation warnings remain (which are normal for Create React App)
✅ **All Pages**: Home, Sessions, Registration, Speakers, etc. are accessible
✅ **Forms**: Registration, Abstract Submission, Contact forms are functional
✅ **Navigation**: All routes are working correctly
✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop layouts working

## Remaining Minor Issues

1. **Webpack Deprecation Warnings**: These are coming from react-scripts and don't affect functionality
2. **VS Code CSS Linting**: Normal warnings for Tailwind directives (expected behavior)

## Dependencies Status

- Tailwind CSS 3.x ✅
