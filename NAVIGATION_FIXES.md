# Navigation Bar Glitching - FIXED

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Layout Overlap Issue**

**Solution**: 
- Added proper padding-top (pt-16) to the Layout component
- Removed conflicting pt-16 from Header component
- Ensured proper z-index layering

### 2. **Mobile Menu Transitions**
**Problem**: Mobile menu appeared/disappeared abruptly causing visual glitches
**Solution**:
- Added smooth CSS transitions with `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out`
- Implemented proper max-height and opacity animations
- Added overflow-hidden to prevent content jumping

### 3. **Mobile Menu UX Issues**

**Solution**:
- Added click-outside handler using useRef and useEffect
- Auto-close menu on route changes

**Solution**:
